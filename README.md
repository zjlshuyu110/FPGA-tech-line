FPGA-Tech-Line
Welcome to my FPGA-Tech-Line repository! This is a personal documentation of my progress and understanding in FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) technology.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to deepen my understanding of FPGA by actively engaging in both theoretical and practical aspects of its application. Unlike a cursory use of technology, I aim to grasp the underlying principles to enhance my ability to innovate and optimize FPGA solutions.

Key Focus Areas
Data Communication: I am exploring ways to send model parameters directly to the FPGA board. This approach is more efficient than writing at the software level, as it streamlines the communication process.

In-Depth Understanding: Inspired by Husky's approach, I'm not just using FPGA as a tool but striving to understand its inner workings. This will enable me to improve and adapt the technology effectively.

Number System Functions: A critical aspect of my study involves exploring number system functions within the FPGA architecture, including both fixed and floating-point systems.

Self-Study and Exploration: Like Husky, who has knowledge without formal study, I am committed to self-learning and exploration, dedicating personal time to understand and innovate in this field.
