# FPGA-Tech-Line

Welcome to my FPGA-Tech-Line repository! This is a personal documentation of my progress and understanding in FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) technology. 

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to deepen my understanding of FPGA by actively engaging in both theoretical and practical aspects of its application. Unlike a cursory use of technology, I aim to grasp the underlying principles to enhance my ability to innovate and optimize FPGA solutions.

## Key Focus Areas

1. **Data Communication**: I am exploring ways to send model parameters directly to the FPGA board. This approach is more efficient than writing at the software level, as it streamlines the communication process.

2. **In-Depth Understanding**: Inspired by Husky's approach, I'm not just using FPGA as a tool but striving to understand its inner workings. This will enable me to improve and adapt the technology effectively.

3. **Number System Functions**: A critical aspect of my study involves exploring number system functions within the FPGA architecture, including both fixed and floating-point systems.

4. **Self-Study and Exploration**: Like Husky, who has knowledge without formal study, I am committed to self-learning and exploration, dedicating personal time to understand and innovate in this field.

## Project Resources and References

- **Bluetooth Software Connection**: [Adding Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Connectivity to the ZedBoard using the Murata 1DX PMOD](https://community.element14.com/products/devtools/avnetboardscommunity/avnetboard-forums/f/zedboard-hardware-design/34027/adding-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-connectivity-to-the-zedboard-using-the-murata-1dx-pmod). This guide is crucial for integrating Bluetooth functionality at the software level without needing kernel modifications for simple applications like a speaker.
